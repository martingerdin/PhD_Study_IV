**Association of age and gender on post-discharge socioeconomic and
quality-of-life outcomes in adult trauma patients in urban India -- a
cohort study**

Introduction

Every year five million people die from trauma with over 90% of these
deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) (1). Trauma
accounts for one-tenth of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)
globally, a burden largely in LMICs (2,3). Improved trauma management
has reduced the number of deaths and there is a shift of attention
towards survivors (4). Therefore, to reduce the global of burden of
disease due to trauma, an important area to focus on is non-fatal trauma
in LMICs (5--7). To establish the long-term burden of trauma and better
plan patient recovery services it is important to understand the factors
that could be associated with post-discharge outcomes (8).

Apart from affecting physiological functioning, trauma also poses social
and economic burden on patients that extends beyond the clinical
setting. It can impede social functioning, job opportunities, access to
services, participation in community life, societal relationships, and
independent living (9--12). It also results in direct and indirect
out-of-pocket expenses leading to catastrophic health costs (13--16).
These factors together substantially affect the health-related quality
of life (QoL) in trauma patients (17--19). Age and sex can modify
post-discharge outcomes among trauma patients (20,21). Limited access to
resources, reduced social capital, disparities in support, and
restricted education and employment opportunities can shape
post-discharge outcomes in women and older trauma patients (22--29).
Consequently, they may become vulnerable to poorer post-discharge
outcomes.

India accounts for nearly 20% of global trauma burden (30). More than
one-tenth of all the DALYs in India are due to trauma and it is among
the top five causes of morbidity (31). However, there are few studies
examining the association of sociodemographic factors, such age and
gender, with post-discharge socio-economic and QoL outcomes among trauma
patients in India. Understanding the association of can provide insights
to improve trauma management and support services in India and other
LMIC settings (32--34). The aim of this study is to assess the
associations between age and sex with post-discharge socioeconomic and
quality-of-life outcomes among adult trauma patients in the context of
urban India.

Methods

Study Design

This study is a []{#anchor}prospective cohort study of trauma patients
discharged from four tertiary-care hospital in urban India over a
12-month period (November 2019-October 2021).

Setting

The patients were enrolled from and on-going the Trauma Audit Filter
Trial (TAFT) in four participating tertiary-care hospitals in Indian
cities. (35). These were the Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedjee
Jeejeebhoy Hospital in Mumbai, Lok Nayak Hospital of Maulana Azad
Medical College (MAMC) in Delhi, the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical
Education and Research and Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital (SSKM)
in Kolkata and St. John\'s Medical College, Bengaluru. The first three
are public hospitals that have nominal fees catering to patients from
lower socio-economic sections of the population, while the fourth is a
charitable private hospital catering to a mix of different
socio-economic sections of the population.

Participants

All patients above the age of 18, which is the legal age for consent in
in India (36), presenting to the casualty department with a history of
trauma---as per the V01-Y36, chapter XX of the International
Classification of Disease version 10 (ICD-10) (37)---who are admitted
and discharged alive will be included in the study.

Variables

Age and gender were the main study variables in this study. We also
included vital sign measures such as systolic blood pressure (SBP),
respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SPO), Injury
severity scores (ISS) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and injury etiology
measures like mode of transport to hospital, type of injury, mechanism
of injury. Additionally, the patients' socioeconomic status measured by
the variables education, occupation, and type of house (38) and the
primary caregiver. Table 1 describes the variables in detail.

Outcomes

Based on reviewing the literature on post-discharge socioeconomic
outcomes studied in trauma patients three outcomes: return to work,
social participation, and social support were selected. These were
defined using the using the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF) Manual developed by the WHO (39).
Health-related quality-of-life outcome was measured using the EQ-5D Tool
(40). EQ-5D is a standardized measure of quality of life using five
dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and
anxiety/depression. Each dimension in the tool has three levels: no
problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patients were
followed up at 12-months since discharge, this was the most common time
point used in most trauma research for subgroups analysis (41).

*Data Source*

Data was collected by one dedicated independent project officer in each
of the hospitals who prospectively gather data on a standardized intake
form for eight hours per day by directly observing the staff delivering
trauma care. Vital signs such as systolic blood pressure, heart-rate,
and oxygen saturation was recorded by the project officer independently.
The project officer was rotated daily through each eight-hour shift in
the morning, evening and night. Data for the variables was collected
from patient records, or from the patient or patient representatives
when they are at the hospital. Additionally, the project officer
followed the patient or the patient relatives at 12-months after
discharge by telephone the for information on the outcomes and any
missed variables.

Bias

There could be bias in collection of data and recording of vital signs
used to calculate injury severity. Adequate training of the project
officers, periodic quality control of the data with external project
officers and weekly online review meetings was done to reduce this bias.

Statistical Methods

Multivariable generalized linear models was used to study the
association of age and gender with the outcomes (42). Depending on the
type of outcomes logistic or multinomial logistic regression was used
estimating 95% confidence intervals and denote associations with a
p-value of \< 0.05 as statistically significant. The statistical
software R was used for all statistical analyses (43).

*Study Size*

Simulation studies indicate that as many as 25 events, observations with
the outcome, and non-events or more per free parameter are required to
obtain stable estimates for logistic regression (44). Given that our
logistic regression model included around 30 free parameters, we need to
include 750 events and at least as many non-events.

*Ethics*

Ethical clearance for the data collection was obtained from the four
participating hospitals as amendments to the existing ethical clearance
for the on-going TAFT project (Grant Medical College & Sir J.J., Group
of Hospitals, Mumbai---No. IEC/Pharm/CT/111/A/2017, Dated 22nd August
2017; Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education, Kolkata---Memo No.
IPGME&R/IEC/2017/396, Dated 21st August 2017; Maulana Azad Medical
College, New Delhi-F.1/IEC/MAMC/(53/2/2016/No.97), Dated 3rd August
2016; St. John's Medical College, Bengaluru---No. IEC/1/671/2017, Dated
24th August, 2017). Waiver of informed consent was granted for
collection of clinical data which was routinely collected for the
patients, as they were all admitted after trauma, often arriving in an
altered level of consciousness and in severe physical and psychological
distress. The amendment granted permission to collect the additional
data necessary for this study as well as for the 12-month follow-up
(Grant Medical College & Sir J.J., Group of Hospitals, Mumbai---No.
IEC/Pharm/CT/2059/2019, Dated 16th September 2019; St. John's Medical
College, Bengaluru---No. IEC/1/530/2019, Dated 25th June, 2019).

*Data management*

Each center was assigned a center identification number and each patient
a locally unique study identification number. Project officers first
entered data on paper without any personal identification data. The
project officers then transferred this data to an electronic format
using a dedicated data entry application. The electronic data did not
include any direct identifiers such as name, hospital record number, and
telephone numbers. The only way to link an electronic record to a paper
intake form was by combining the record's hospital and study
identification numbers. Paper forms were kept locally at each center for
the duration required by locally applicable laws and regulations, or at
least five years, whichever is longest. The adequacy of their storage
was the responsibility of the principal investigator at each center.
Care was taken taken to ensure that at no time where they stored with
less than reasonable care. The center specific data will be owned by
each center.
