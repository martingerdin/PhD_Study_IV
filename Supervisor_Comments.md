Q: I would like to know the relevance of Vital signs and all the parameters listed in the tables, to the Post-discharge outcomes. 
The many tables and variables are from the dataset, but the logical connection between the variables is missing. 

A: We have wanted to include variables that shown in literature to influence injury severity and can consequently affect post-discharge QOL. We have mentioned this is the methods.

Q: The logic of this argument on the aims-methods-discussion axis is weak, the paper masquerades as a qualitative paper, with an overemphasis on statistical tools to prove that these two variables (age and gender) are important. They are treated like blood pressure and GCS and therefore appears contrived and disjointed. While this feedback has been given before, it is being repeated here again, so that it is considered - Age and Gender seem to be an after-thought after significance questing. They are being foregrounded as they are statistically significant, not because they are major sociological and contextual determinants indicators. To save my breath and words, I would like to just cut-paste my previous comments (from the previous paper) that age and gender are not adequately explored.

Start quote:
  That the patients are essentially poor or lower-middle-class does not come through in this economic paper. Also, I find my previous comment of explaining the concept of home (for the international audience) ignored. I don't think the international reader understands how it is to live in a slum, using a common toilet, squatting in a toilet, whether there is plumbed water, how many people are under one roof, what was the average income of the injured person (in US dollars). Since it is exploratory, this is the minimum exploration that I would think is necessary. If the above was not included in your home/telephonic interview, nothing can be done, but it is a learning lesson. To repeat my 8th March comment "are the vital contextual components of this paper and quintessentially Indian. If all else is dropped, and if the Indian-ness of the post-injury context is retained, it would be stellar."
You must have a good reason why we are shying away from having a qualifier for the 39 year old woman, who returned to work early and is perhaps not comparable to the rest.
End quote.

A: We have tried to emphasize the rationale of looking at the association of age and gender with QOL in the Introduction. We have added a few lines of description in the "Participants"in the Methods section.
