Introduction
============
Trauma contributes to one-tenth of the global disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) bearing a disproportionate burden of the morbidity  [@GBD2019DemographicsCollaborators2020; @Haagsma2019]. To address this burden it is important to understand the long-term outcomes of trauma and the different factors associated with these outcomes, especially in LMICs  [@Kruithof2017; @Wisborg2017; @Rios-Diaz2017]. This encompasses a range of socioeconomic outcomes including  health-related quality of life (QOL) [@Ahmed2017; @Nguyen2017; @Hossain2020; @Jagnoor2019]. 

Age and gender are associated with post-discharge QOL among trauma patients. Elderly populations and women tend to have limited access to resources, reduced social capital, disparities in support, poor health-seeking behavior, and restricted education and employment opportunities [@Amurwon2019;@Levasseur2015; @Brinda2016; @Gupta2019; @Kennedy2020]. This can shape their post-discharge well-being and outcomes after trauma [@Waqas2017; @Awang2018; @Quadir2019; @Fabricius2020]. Consequently, older age and being a women can make trauma patients more vulnerable to poorer post-discharge QOL [@Gopinath2017;@Brown2017c; @Mollayeva2018;@Rissanen2020]. There is some evidence that older women may have higher morbidity in LMIC settings [@Carmel2019; @Agrawal2014]. There is little research on the interaction between age and gender on QOL among post-discharge trauma patients in this setting. 

Understanding the interaction between age and gender on QOL may provide insights for improving trauma management and developing support services in LMIC settings [@Meara2015; @Babhulkar2019]. The aim of this study is to assess the interaction of age and gender with post-discharge QOL among adult trauma patients using the context of urban India. 

Methods
=======

Study Design
------------

This study is a prospective cohort study of trauma patients discharged from four tertiary-care hospital in urban India between November 2019 and October 2021.

Setting
-------
India accounts for nearly 20% of global trauma burden [@GBD2019DemographicsCollaborators2020]. More than one-tenth of all the DALYs in India are due to trauma and it is among the top five causes of morbidity [@Menon2019]. The patients were enrolled from the on-going Trauma Audit Filters Trial (TAFT) in four participating tertiary-care hospitals in Indian cities. [@ClinicalTrials.gov2017]. These were the Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Hospital in Mumbai, Lok Nayak Hospital of Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) in Delhi, the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research and Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital (SSKM) in Kolkata and St. John's Medical College, Bengaluru. The first three are public hospitals that have nominal fees catering to patients from lower socioeconomic sections of the population, while the fourth is a charitable private hospital catering to a mix of different socioeconomic sections of the population.

Participants
------------

We include patients aged 18, which is the legal age for consent in in India [@IndianCouncilofMedicalResearch2006],  presenting to the casualty department with a history of trauma---as per the V01-Y36, chapter XX of the International Classification of Disease version 10 (ICD-10) [@WordHealthOrganization2016]--who are admitted and discharged alive.

Variables
---------
Age and gender were the main  variables for this study. We also included vital sign measures such as systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SPO), Injury severity scores (ISS) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and injury etiology measures like mode of transport to hospital, type of injury, mechanism of injury, and length of hospital stay.

Outcomes
--------
Health-related quality-of-life outcome was measured using the EQ-5D Tool [@EuroQolGroup]. EQ-5D is a standardized measure of quality of life using five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension in the tool has three levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. Additionally there is a visual analog scale (VAS) The patients were followed up at 3-months. EQ-5D tool can be administered over the telephone and has translations available in multiple Indian languages  [@EuroQolGroup]

Data Source
-----------

Data was collected by one dedicated independent project officer in each of the hospitals who prospectively gather data on a standardized intake form for eight hours per day, five days a week, by directly observing the staff delivering trauma care. Vital signs such as systolic blood pressure, heart-rate, and oxygen saturation was recorded by the project officer independently.  The project officer was rotated daily through each eight-hour shift in the morning, evening and night. Data for the variables was collected from patient records, or from the patient or patient representatives when they are at the hospital. Additionally, the project officer followed the patient or the patient relatives at 3-months after discharge by telephone the for information on the outcomes and any missed variables.

Bias
----

There could be bias in collection of data and recording of vital signs used to calculate injury severity. Adequate training of the project officers, periodic quality control of the data with external project
officers and weekly online review meetings was done to reduce this bias.

Statistical Methods
-------------------

Multivariable linear models was used to study the association of age and gender with the QOL estimating 95% confidence intervals and denote associations with a p-value of less than 0.05 as statistically significant  [@Carey2013]. The statistical software R was used for all statistical analyses [@RCoreTeam2015].

Study Size
----------

Simulation studies indicate that as many as 25 events, observations with the outcome, and non-events or more per free parameter are required to obtain stable estimates for logistic regression [@Courvoisier2011]. Given that our logistic regression model included around 18 free parameters, we need to include 375 events and at least as many non-events.
<!-- So event is an observation with the outcome. Which outcome are you using as the basis of this calculation?-->
<!-- SD: Oh, first, I was using the variables (age, gender, etc.). If I am using the outcomes EQ-5D VAS score (low, medium, high based on cut-off scores on the general population?) and the 5 domains with 3 levels each, so its 3 + 15 so 18. 375 events plus 375 non-events. That makes it 750? -->.

Ethics
------

Ethical clearance for the data collection was obtained from the four participating hospitals as amendments to the existing ethical clearance for the on-going TAFT project (Grant Medical College & Sir J.J., Group
of Hospitals, Mumbai---No. IEC/Pharm/CT/111/A/2017, Dated 22nd August 2017; Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education, Kolkata---Memo No. IPGME&R/IEC/2017/396, Dated 21st August 2017; Maulana Azad Medical
College, New Delhi-F.1/IEC/MAMC/(53/2/2016/No.97), Dated 3rd August 2016; St. John's Medical College, Bengaluru---No. IEC/1/671/2017, Dated 24th August, 2017). Waiver of informed consent was granted for collection of clinical data which was routinely collected for the patients, as they were all admitted after trauma, often arriving in an altered level of consciousness and in severe physical and psychological distress. The amendment granted permission to collect the additional data necessary for this study (Grant  Medical College & Sir J.J., Group of Hospitals, Mumbai---No. IEC/Pharm/CT/2059/2019, Dated 16th September 2019; St. John's Medical College, Bengaluru---No. IEC/1/530/2019, Dated 25th June, 2019).

Data management
---------------

Each center was assigned a center identification number and each patient a locally unique study identification number. Project officers first entered data on paper without any personal identification data. The project officers then transferred this data to an electronic format using a dedicated data entry application. The electronic data did not include any direct identifiers such as name, hospital record number, and telephone numbers. The only way to link an electronic record to a paper intake form was by combining the record's hospital and study identification numbers. Paper forms were kept locally at each center for the duration required by locally applicable laws and regulations, or at least five years, whichever is longest. The adequacy of their storage was the responsibility of the principal investigator at each center. Care was taken taken to ensure that at no time where they stored with less than reasonable care.
